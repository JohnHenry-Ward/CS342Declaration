                The internet has changed our world in unprecedented ways. It has connected millions of people across the globe. It truly was, and still is, a new frontier that is difficult to navigate. The creation of the internet has created issues that we have still yet to adapt to. The common human is not fluent in how the internet works, and yet many use it every day. This has created issues that we still don’t know how to adapt to. Whether it be large companies taking advantage of the consumer through privacy violations, users hiding behind faceless accounts and avoiding repercussions for inappropriate actions, or even the fact that the internet is not accessible to everyone. We declare that corporations should be open and transparent about how users data is being used, that users who hide from consequences behind anonymity be rightfully punished, and that internet access should be a public utility for all.

                    In an age of super-massive corporations hell-bent on squeezing every last penny from the average internet consumer, data reigns supreme. These tech giants, propped up by venture capitalists, only stand a chance of profiting through selling user data and advertising, two things which have proven to go hand in hand. Individuals traits and tendencies are constantly being recorded to build profiles which can then be sold or used internally to perform targeted advertising. Although using a person’s internet psychology to convince them to buy a Snuggie on Amazon may seem harmless, these techniques can be more sinister when used in the political realm. Firms with the likes of Cambridge Analytica have proven to be very effective in influencing elections, such as Brexit and the 2016 US Presidential Election, with the help of millions of Facebook user data points. Users of an app called “This is Your Digital Life” who used their Facebook account to login, unknowingly shared their personal info and friend networks with the company. For this reason Facebook claims it is not at fault.

                    The anonymity and massive communication bandwidth of the internet has provided toxic ideals to spread like wildfire. Previously, people with these beliefs were under the radar and operated in small numbers. Today however it’s much easier for people interested in terrorism or Nazism for example to congregate and organize at a large scale. While public shunning was a major deterrent from this behavior in the past, the anonymity of the internet allows such groups to wield much more influence over public discourse. It’s difficult to find a solution to this. Finding the balance between limiting the power and influence of dangerous ideas and killing freedom of speech is a balancing act that must be managed with the utmost care. While a great solution to this issue is far from being reached, the government and corporate regulations that we have now are ineffective.

                    It is becoming increasingly true that to be disconnected from the internet is to be disconnected from society.  Work is and will continue to be remote for many, cultural products like movies and television are more and more choosing to forego physical releases to be web exclusives, and socialization is slowly moving away from the real world into online forums and Discord servers.  As this reliance upon the web becomes stronger, those who don't have access to it will find themselves alienated and struggling to make ends meet. It is estimated that "around 25 million Americans" do not have access to internet according to now former chairman of the Federal Communications Comission Ajit Pai. However, Microsoft's own research "indicates 162.8 million people are not using the internet at broadband speeds" (Forbes). It is therefore important that the internet be accessible and reliable to all. Internet providers, however, are inclined to give more and better access to communities from which it can receive more profit, leaving poorer communities in the dust.  This will continue for as long as the primary incentive for these service providers is profit.  The solution, then, is some form of socialized internet, freely available for anyone at any time and any place. A public utility, much like water, electric or sewage, seems to be the way to go. This would require service providers to offer afforable high speed broadband to all Americans, therefore creating a right to internet access for all. <b>To read more, click the image.</b>
